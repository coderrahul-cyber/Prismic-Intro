### What is a CMS?

A Content Management System (CMS) is a software application that allows users to create, edit, manage, and publish digital content without needing to write code. It provides a user-friendly interface for content creators and editors to manage website content efficiently.

### What is a Headless CMS?

A headless CMS is a type of CMS that provides content management capabilities without a front-end delivery layer. Instead of being tied to a specific presentation layer, a headless CMS delivers content via APIs, allowing developers to use any front-end technology to present the content.

### Why is a Headless CMS Useful for Developers?

- **Flexibility**: Developers can use any front-end framework or technology to build the user interface.
- **Scalability**: Decoupling the front-end and back-end allows for better scalability and performance.
- **Future-Proofing**: Easily switch or upgrade front-end technologies without changing the CMS.
- **Omnichannel Delivery**: Deliver content to multiple platforms (web, mobile, IoT) from a single source.

### How Does a Headless CMS Help?

- **Streamlined Content Management**: Content creators can manage and update content without developer intervention.
- **Faster Development**: Developers can focus on building the front-end without worrying about the back-end content management.
- **Improved Collaboration**: Content teams and developers can work independently, improving productivity and collaboration.

Prismic.io, as a headless CMS, provides these benefits, making it a powerful tool for modern web development.
